# jGraph

Commands:

Z: zoom
U: unzoom

Arrows to move the camera (yes i implemented a camera system with zoom and movement from scratch)

N: change coordinate place
R: remove last placed point

C: show calculations

To insert a new point:
just type in the x coordinate, press enter,
type in the y coordinate, press enter
boom new point is added

BE AWARE, TO ADD NEGATIVE SIGN PRESS 'M'
TO ADD A POINT PRESS 'P'
'-' and '.' will NOT work

If you wish to start the graph from scratch
or change the starting graph simply change
the the contents of files/toLoad.txt.
if the file is non existant the program will start
with a blanck graph, if it does it'll load up like this:

coordinateX1 coordinateY1
coordinateX2 coordinateY2
........... ...........
coordinateXn coordinateYn

please do not mess up the file formatting as i haven't
checked the formatting and it may cause undefines behaviour
